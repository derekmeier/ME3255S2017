# Optimization

Many problems involve finding a minimum or maximum based on given constraints. Engineers and scientists typically use energy balance equations to find the conditions of minimum energy, but this value may never go to 0 and the actual value of energy may not be of interest. 

The Lennard-Jones potential is commonly used to model interatomic bonding. 

$E_{LJ}(x)=4\epsilon \left(\left(\frac{\sigma}{x}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma}{x}\right)^{6}\right)$

Considering a 1-D gold chain, we can calculate the bond length, $x_{b}$, with no force applied to the chain and even for tension, F. This will allow us to calculate the nonlinear spring constant of a 1-D gold chain.

### First, let's find the minimum energy $\min(E_{LJ}(x))$

## Brute force


```octave
setdefaults
epsilon = 0.039; % kcal/mol
sigma = 2.934; % Angstrom
x=linspace(2.8,6,200); % bond length in Angstrom

Ex = lennard_jones(x,sigma,epsilon);

[Emin,imin]=min(Ex);

plot(x,Ex,x(imin),Emin,'o')
```

    ans =  3.2824
    ans =  3.2985
    ans =  3.3146


## Golden Search Algorithm

We can't just look for a sign change for the problem (unless we can take a derivative) so we need a new approach to determine whether we have a maximum between the two bounds.

Rather than using the midpoint of initial bounds, here the problem is more difficult. We need to compare the values of 4 function evaluations. The golden search uses the golden ratio to determine two interior points.

Start with bounds of 2.5 and 6 Angstrom.

## Parabolic Interpolation

Near a minimum/maximum, the function resembles a parabola. With three data points, it is possible to fit a parabola to the function. So, given a lower and upper bound, we can choose the midpoint and fit a parabola to the 3 x,f(x) coordinates. 

$ x_{4} =x_{2} - \frac{1}{2}  \frac{ \left(x_{2} -x_{1}  \right)^{2}  \left[f
 \left(x_{2}  \right)-f \left(x_{3} \right) \right]- \left(x_{2} -x_{3}  \right)^{2}
 \left[f \left(x_{2}  \right)-f \left(x_{1}  \right) \right]}{ \left(x_{2} -x_{1}  \right) \left[f \left(x_{2}  \right)-f \left(x_{3}  \right)
 \right]- \left(x_{2} -x_{3}  \right) \left[f \left(x_{2}  \right)-f \left(x_{1} \right) \right]}$

Where $x_{4}$ location of the maximum or minimum of the parabola.

Parabolic interpolation does not converge in many scenarios even though it it a bracketing method. Instead, functions like `fminbnd` in Matlab and Octave use a combination of the two (Golden Ratio and Parabolic)

## Using the solutions to minimization for the nonlinear spring constant

Now, we have two routines to find minimums of a univariate function (Golden Ratio and Parabolic). Let's use these to solve for the minimum energy given a range of applied forces to the single atom gold chain

$E_{total}(\Delta x) = E_{LJ}(x_{min}+\Delta x) - F \cdot \Delta x$


```octave
epsilon = 0.039; % kcal/mol
epsilon = epsilon*6.9477e-21; % J/atom
epsilon = epsilon*1e18; % aJ/J
% final units for epsilon are aJ

sigma = 2.934; % Angstrom
sigma = sigma*0.10; % nm/Angstrom
x=linspace(2.8,6,200)*0.10; % bond length in um

Ex = lennard_jones(x,sigma,epsilon);

%[Emin,imin]=min(Ex);

[xmin,Emin] = fminbnd(@(x) lennard_jones(x,sigma,epsilon),0.28,0.6)

plot(x,Ex,xmin,Emin,'o')
ylabel('Lennard Jones Potential (aJ/atom)')
xlabel('bond length (nm)')

Etotal = @(dx,F) lennard_jones(xmin+dx,sigma,epsilon)-F.*dx;

```

    xmin =  0.32933
    Emin =   -2.7096e-04

For this function, it is possible to take a derivative and compare the analytical result:


```octave
dx_full=linspace(0,0.06,50);
F= @(dx) 4*epsilon*6*(sigma^6./(xmin+dx).^7-2*sigma^12./(xmin+dx).^13)
plot(dx_full,F(dx_full),dx,F_applied)
```

    F =
    
    @(dx) 4 * epsilon * 6 * (sigma ^ 6 ./ (xmin + dx) .^ 7 - 2 * sigma ^ 12 ./ (xmin + dx) .^ 13)

## Curve-fitting
Another example is minimizing error in your approximation of a function. If you have data (now we have Force-displacement data) we can fit this to a function, such as:

$F(x) = K_{1}\Delta x + \frac{1}{2} K_{2}(\Delta x)^{2}$



```octave
function SSE = sse_of_parabola(K,xdata,ydata)
    % calculate the sum of squares error for a parabola given a function, func, and xdata and ydata
    % output is SSE=sum of squares error
    K1=K(1);
    K2=K(2);
    y_function = K1*xdata+1/2*K2*xdata.^2;
    SSE = sum((ydata-y_function).^2);
end
    
```


```octave
[K,SSE_min]=fminsearch(@(K) sse_of_parabola(K,dx,F_applied),[1,1]);
fprintf('\nThe nonlinear spring constants are K1=%1.2f nN/nm and K2=%1.2f nN/nm^2\n',K)
fprintf('The mininum sum of squares error = %1.2e',SSE_min)
```

    
    The nonlinear spring constants are K1=0.16 nN/nm and K2=-5.98 nN/nm^2
    The mininum sum of squares error = 7.35e-08



```octave
plot(dx,F_applied,'o',dx,K(1)*dx+1/2*K(2)*dx.^2)
```
